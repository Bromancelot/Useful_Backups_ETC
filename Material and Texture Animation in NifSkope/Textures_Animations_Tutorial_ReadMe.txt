Brief Description:
=====================

This tutorial in 4 parts, result of about two years of work, demonstrates the creation of simple Material and Texture animations using NifSkope. All meshes and textures used by the tutorials are included as resources for work.

I'll update this as I receive feedback about anything I got wrong or any additional information, with credits.

==================
Details:
==================

Texture animations can be created in NifSkope, by inserting a few controller blocks and by adjusting their settings.

This tutorials tries to explain the process to follow to achieve this and assists you in the creation of Material Animations such as glowing animations or transparency animations, and Textures Animations such as rotation, translation, zooming and film-like animations.
And lastely, how to create sequences of these and trigger them via scripts.

With the help of simple meshes and custom textures included in the package, you'll be able to rebuild simple animations by following the illustrated step-by-step process.

Some understanding of the UV map and of the structure of a .nif file and basic NifSkope editing skills will help to follow these exercices, but I have tried my best to details and illustrate each step. 

Some basic notions are given in Part 1: An Introduction. It is recommended to read and and follow all the tutorials in order, as they have been developed accordingly.
